# Zero Trust Micro-VPN for Campus Networks

## Overview

This project implements a Zero Trust-based Micro-VPN architecture integrated with a secure student management portal. It enforces identity-aware, role-based, and continuously verified access to campus resources.

Traditional VPNs grant broad access once connected. This system eliminates that risk by applying Zero Trust principles such as continuous authentication, least privilege access, and microsegmentation.

## Zero Trust Implementation

The system enforces key Zero Trust principles:

* Never trust, always verify
* Least privilege access
* Continuous authentication
* Microsegmentation

### Trust Score System

* Initial trust score: 100
* Decreases on:

  * Failed login attempts
  * OTP failures
  * Suspicious behavior
* Impacts:

  * Access permissions
  * MFA requirements
  * Session restrictions

* Hybrid encryption (AES + RSA)
* Device fingerprinting
* Trust scoring engine

### Frontend
